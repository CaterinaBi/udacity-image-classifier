# Create your own image classifier

> Final capstone that I'm working on as part of the [AI programming in Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) nanodegree at Udacity. The aim of the project is to build a Python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, and then predict new images using the trained model.

The project implements an image classification application. The application trains a deep learning model on a data set of images, then uses tha trained model to classify images. The code is first implemented in a Jupyter notebook to make sure the training implementation works, and then it is converted into a Python application that runs from the command line.
